**Ameba ARDUINO: Getting Started with RTL8722DM MINI**

Required Environment

AmebaD RTL8722DM_MINI currently supports Windows XP/7/8/10 32-bits and
64-bits, Linux and Mac operating systems. In this documentation, please
use Arduino IDE with version 1.8.12 or later.

Introduction to AmebaD RTL8722DM_MINI

Ameba is an easy-to-program platform for developing all kind of IoT
applications. AmebaD is equipped with various peripheral interfaces,
including WiFi, GPIO INT, I2C, UART, SPI, PWM, ADC. Through these
interfaces, AmebaD can connect with electronic components such as LED,
switches, manometer, hygrometer, PM2.5 dust sensors, …etc.

The collected data can be uploaded via WiFi and be utilized by
applications on smart devices to realize IoT implementation.

Setting up Development Environment

Step 1. Installing the Driver

First, connect RTL8722DM_MINI to the computer via Micro USB(same as
power):

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image2.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-4
   :width: 337
   :height: 558
   :scale: 100 %

| If this is the first time you connect RTL8722DM_MINI to your computer,
  the USB driver for RTL8722DM_MINI will be automatic installed.
| You can check the COM port number in Device Manager of your computer:

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image4.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-5
   :width: 298
   :height: 628
   :scale: 100 %

Step 2. Set up Arduino IDE

From version 1.6.5, Arduino IDE supports third-party hardware.
Therefore, we can use Arduino IDE to develop applications on
RTL8722DM_MINI, and the examples of Arduino can run on RTL8722DM_MINI
too. Refer to `basic example
link <https://www.amebaiot.com.cn/amebad-mini-arduino-compatible-ex/>`__.

| Arduino IDE can be downloaded in the Arduino
  website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
| When the installation is finished, open Arduino IDE. To set up
  RTL8722DM_MINI correctly in Arduino IDE, go to “File” ->
  “Preferences”.

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image5.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-6
   :width: 386
   :height: 441
   :scale: 100 %

And paste the following URL into “Additional Boards Manager URLs”
field: https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/raw/master/Arduino_package/package_realtek.com_amebad_index.json

Next, go to “Tools” -> “Board” -> “Boards Manager”:

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image6.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-7
   :width: 664
   :height: 600
   :scale: 100 %

The “Boards Manager” requires about 10~20 seconds to refresh all
hardware files (if the network is in bad condition, it may take longer).
Every time the new hardware is connected, we need to reopen the Board
Manager. So, we close the Boards Manager, and then open it again. Find
“Realtek AmebaD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M4 @200MHz)” in the list,
click “Install”, then the Arduino IDE starts to download required files
for AmebaD.

   :alt: get-start-8
   :width: 800
   :height: 450
   :scale: 50 %

| If you are facing GitHub downloading issue, please refer to the
  following link at “Download/Software Development Kit”. There are 3
  sections.
| 1. “AmebaD_Arduino_patch1_SDK”, please select at least 1 of the SDKs.
  There are 5 latest released SDK options.
| 2. “AmebaD_Arduino_patch2_Tools”, please select according to your
  operation system. There are Windows, Linux and MacOS.
| 3. “AmebaD_Arduino_Source_Code”, this section is optional download
  only wants to refer the latest source code.

`https://www.amebaiot.com.cn/en/ameba-arduino-summary/ <https://www.amebaiot.com.cn/ameba-arduino-summary/>`__

Download the files selected, then unzip (patch1 and patch2 are
compulsory). There are “Install.doc”/“Install.pdf” for you to refer
installation steps. According to your system, please run the
installation tool in the “Offline_SDK_installation_tool” folder.

After the installation tool running successfully, you may open Arduino
IDE and proceed to “tools” -> “Board“ -> “Boards Manager…”. Try to find
“Realtek AmebaD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M4 @200MHz)” in the list,
click “Install”, then the Arduino IDE starts to download required files
for AmebaD.

Finally, we select AmebaD as current connected board in “tools” ->
“Board” -> “Ameba ARM (32-bits) Boards” ->” RTL8722DM_MINI”：

   :scale: 50 %

Try the First Example

Step 1. Compile & Upload

| Arduino IDE provides many built-in examples, which can be compiled,
  uploaded and run directly on the boards. Here, we take the “Blink”
  example as the first try.
| Open “File” -> “Examples” -> “01.Basics” -> “Blink”:

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image9.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-10
   :width: 588
   :height: 711
   :scale: 100 %

Arduino IDE opens a new window with the complete sample code.

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image10.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-11
   :width: 678
   :height: 746
   :scale: 50 %

| There are onboard LED of TRL8722DM_MINI, the default “LED_BUILTIN” is
  blue onboard LE.D
| Change “LED_BUILTIN” to “LED_B” or “LED_G” for different colour.
  Onboard LEDs options LED_B and LED_G. (blue and green).

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image11.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-12
   :width: 393
   :height: 613
   :scale: 100 %

Next, we compile the sample code directly; click “Sketch” ->
“Verify/Compile”

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image12.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-13
   :width: 678
   :height: 746
   :scale: 50 %

Arduino IDE prints the compiling messages in the bottom area of the IDE
window. When the compilation is finished, you will get the message
similar to the following figure:

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image13.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-14
   :width: 678
   :height: 746
   :scale: 50 %

| Afterwards, we will upload the compiled code to RTL8722DM_MINI.
| Please make sure RTL8722DM_MINI is connected to your computer, then
  click “Sketch” -> “Upload”.
| The Arduino IDE will compile first then upload. During the uploading
  process, users are required to enter the upload mode of the board.
  Arduino IDE will wait 5s for DEV board to enter the upload mode.

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image14.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-15
   :width: 711
   :height: 752
   :scale: 50 %

To enter the upload mode, first press and hold the UART_DOWNLOAD button,
then press the RESET button. If success, you should see the onboard
green LED and blue LED all turned off.

.. image:: ../media/RTL8722DM_mini_Arduino_SDK_getting_start/image15.jpeg
   :alt: get-start-16
   :width: 528
   :height: 459
   :scale: 100 %

Again, during the uploading procedure the IDE prints messages. Uploading
procedure takes considerably longer time (about 30 seconds to 1 minute).
When upload completed, the “Done uploading” message is printed.

Run the Blink example

| In each example, Arduino not only provides sample code, but also
  detailed documentation, including wiring diagram, sample code
  explanation, technical details, …etc. These examples can be directly
  used on RTL8722DM_MINI.
| So, we find the detailed information of the Blink example:
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Blink

| In short, for RTL8722DM_MINI, the example can be run on both onboard
  LEDs (green or blue) or external LED (use any GPIO pins for signal
  output).
| Finally, press the RESET button, and you can see the LED blinking.
| If you encounter any problem, please refer to Troubleshooting.
