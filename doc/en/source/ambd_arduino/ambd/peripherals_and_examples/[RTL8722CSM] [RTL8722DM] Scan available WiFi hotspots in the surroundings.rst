[RTL8722CSM] [RTL8722DM] Scan available WiFi hotspots in the surroundings
==========================================================================
Materials

-  Ameba x 1

-  Antenna x 1

Example

In this example, we use Ameba to scan available WiFi hotspots in the
surroundings, and prints the SSID, encryption type, signal strength
information of each detected hotspot.

First, make sure the correct Ameba development board is selected in
Arduino IDE: “Tools” -> “Board” ->

Open the “ScanNetworks” example in “File” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaWiFi”
-> “ScanNetworks”:

.. image:: ../media/[RTL8722CSM]_[RTL8722DM]_Scan_available_WiFi_hotspots_in_the_surroundings/image1.png
   :alt: wifi-1-2
   :width: 716
   :height: 1006
   :scale: 50 %

 

Then upload the sample code and press the reset button on Ameba.
Afterwards, you can see “**Scan Networks**” message appears, with the
detected WiFi hotspots and the information of each hotspot.

Code Reference

| First we use WiFi.macAddress(mac) to get the MAC address of Ameba:
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiMACAddress
| Then we use WiFi.scanNetworks() to detect WiFi hotspots:
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiScanNetworks
| To get information of detected WiFi hotspot:
| We use WiFi.SSID(thisNet) to retrieve SSID of a network:
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiSSID
| We use WiFi.RSSI(thisNet) to get the signal strength of the connection
  to the router:
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiRSSI
| We use WiFi.encryptionType(thisNet) to get the encryption type of the
  network:

Comparison with Arduino

In the Arduino platform, we need to add an extra WiFi shield to be the
WiFi module to realize the WiFi connection. And we must #include to use
SPI to communicate with WiFi module.

However, Ameba is already equipped with WiFi module. Therefore, #include
is not needed.
