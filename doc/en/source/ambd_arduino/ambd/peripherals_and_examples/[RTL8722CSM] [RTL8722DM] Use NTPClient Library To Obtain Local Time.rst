[RTL8722CSM] [RTL8722DM] Use NTPClient Library To Obtain Local Time
=====================================================================
Preparation

-  Ameba x 1

Example

In this example, we use an NTP client to sync with NTP servers using UDP
and keep track of time locally. Open the example. “File” -> “Examples”
-> “NTPClient” -> “Advanced”\ |1|\ Modify the highlighted code section
(ssid, password) to connect to your WiFi network.\ |image1|\ Compile the
code and upload it to Ameba. After pressing the Reset button, Ameba
connects to WiFi, gets the UTC time from the NTP server, and prints out
the current time with time zone offset to the serial monitor.\ |image2|

Code Reference

Configure NTP client: The NTPClient needs to use a UDP client for
communications. A WiFiUDP client is declared and passed to the NTPClient
constructor, along with an NTP server address, time zone offset in
seconds, and update interval in milliseconds. If detailed configuration
is not needed, just passing in the UDP client is also sufficient, refer
to the “NTPClient” -> “Basic” example.

WiFiUDP ntpUDP;

NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP, “europe.pool.ntp.org”, 3600, 60000);

Start NTP client: After connecting to WiFi, the NTPClient is started
using the begin() function, which causes the client to sync with the NTP
server and get the UTC time.

WiFiUDP ntpUDP;

timeClient.begin();

Get local time: getFormattedTime() is used to format the received UTC
time into the local time zone. update() is called every loop so that the
NTPClient will sync with the NTP server once every update interval.

timeClient.update();

timeClient.getFormattedTime();
