**Steps**

MicroPython has provided rich functions to deal with time and delay, here are some examples.

Copy and paste the following code line by line into REPL to see its effect.



.. code-block:: html
   :linenos:
   
   import time
   time.sleep(1) # sleep for 1 second
   time.sleep_ms(500) # sleep for 500 milliseconds
   time.sleep_us(10) # sleep for 10 microseconds
   start = time.ticks_ms() # get millisecond counter
