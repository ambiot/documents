Introduction to RTL8722 MicroPython port
========================================

Background Information
----------------------

MicroPython, by definition, is a lean and efficient Python3 compiler and
runtime specially designed for microcontrollers.

MicroPython distinguishes itself from other compilation-based platforms
(Arduino etc.) with its powerful method of real-time interaction to
Microcontroller through a built-in feature -- REPL.

REPL stands for Read-Evaluation-Print-Loop, it is an interactive prompt
that you can use to access and control your microcontroller.

REPL has been equipped with other powerful features such as tab
completion, line editing, auto-indentation, input history and more. It
basically functions like the classic Python IDLE but running on
microcontroller.

To use REPL, simply open any serial terminal software (most common ones
are teraterm, putty etc.) on your PC and connect to your
microcontroller's serial port, then set baudrate to 115200 before
manually reset the board, then you will see >>> MicroPython prompt
appear on the terminal. Now you may type in any Python script on REPL as
long as it's support by MicroPython and your microcontroller's
MicroPython port.

Most importantly, try to abuse "help()" function as much as possible to
gain more information. For example, upon microcontroller power up and
REPL shown, just type

>>> help()

You will see a help page giving you more details about this port; also
if you type

>>> help(modules)

it will list out all available builtin modules that are at your disposal

Furthermore, if you want to learn more about a module, such as its API
and CONSTANT available, simply type the following code and details of
that module will be returned to you,

>>> help(the module of your interest)

Let's take Pin module (GPIO) as an example:

>>> help(Pin)
object <class 'Pin'> is of type type
  id -- <function>
  init -- <function>
  value -- <function>
  off -- <function>
  on -- <function>
  toggle -- <function>
  board -- <class 'board'>
  IN -- 0
  OUT -- 1
  PULL_NONE -- 0
  PULL_UP -- 1
  PULL_DOWN -- 2


REPL Hotkeys
------------

-  Ctrl + d :

Soft reboot MicroPython will perform software reboot, this is useful
when your microcontroller is behaving abnormally. This will also run
scripts in 'boot.py' once again. Note that this will only reset the
MicroPython interpreter not the hardware, all your previously configured
hardware will stay the way it is until you manually hard-reset the
board.

-  Ctrl + e :

Paste mode Paste mode allow you to perform pasting a large trunk of code
into REPL at once without executing code line by line. This is useful
when you have found a MicroPython library and wish to test it out
immediately by copy and paste

-  Ctrl + b :

Normal mode This hotkey will set REPL back to normal mode. This is
useful if you are stuck in certain mode and can not get out.

-  Ctrl + c :

Quick cancel This hotkey help you to cancel any input and return a new
line

Setting up Development Environment
==================================

Step 1. Installing the Driver
-----------------------------

First, connect AmebaD to the computer via Micro USB:

|get-start-4|

| If this is the first time you connect AmebaD to your computer, the USB
  driver for AmebaD will be automatic installed.
| You can check the COM port number in Device Manager of your computer:

|get-start-5|

Step 2. Installing the necessary tools
--------------------------------------

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^

For windows users, please install a serial terminal software to interact
with MicroPython. The most common serial terminals are **Tera Term** and
**Putty,** here we recommend using Tera Term, which can be downloaded
from internet.

For advanced developer who wish to compile MicroPython firmware from
scratch, then please be sure to install **Cygwin**, which is a
Linux-like environment running on Windows system. When selecting the
Cygwin installer, we recommend using the Cygwin 32-bit version. During
Cygwin installation, installer will prompt user if wish to install other
software, please make sure to select the GNU version of **make** from
the **Devel** category (see picture below) and pick the latest edition.

|image1|

Also, Python3 is required during firmware compilation, so be sure to
download the latest Python3 from its official website and have it added
as environment variable when asked during installation.

.. _section-1:

On Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^

For Linux user, please install a serial terminal software of your choice
using apt-get install command. Here we recommend using **picocom** for
its lightweight.

For advanced developer interested in developing MicroPython module in C,
please make sure the GNU make of at least version 3.82 or newer and
Python3 are installed and can be found using terminal.

Upload Firmware into Ameba
==========================

Step 1. Navigate to “Release” folder
------------------------------------

After downloading the MicroPython repository from Github, you will
notice a “Release” folder in the root directory of this repository,
enter this folder and locate a tool named “Double-Click-Me-to-Upload”.

Step 2. Enter UART Download mode
--------------------------------

To do this, first press and hold the UART_DOWNLOAD button, then press
the RESET button. If success, you should see a green LED flashing on
your ameba.

|get-start-15|

Step 3. Run “Double-Click-Me-to-Upload”
---------------------------------------

As the name suggested, double click on the file to run it, follow
instructions printed on the screen to update the ameba’s serial COM port
(this is known to us during the driver installation step mentioned
above) so the uploading can be carried out successfully. Once the
uploading is successful, you will see a line of log printed on the
screen – “All images are sent successfully”

Try the First Example
=====================

Step 1. Open REPL
-----------------

|image2|

REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop, it is the
MicroPython’s terminal for user to control the microcontroller. REPL is
running on LOG UART, thus we need to open our serial terminal software,
in this case, Tera Term to see REPL,

Once Tera Term is opened, select “Serial” like in the picture above and
choose your ameba’s serial port using the dropdown list, after that, hit
“OK”. If your serial terminal is not configured to 115200 baud rate, now
is the time to change it to **115200** and leave the rest of settings as
default.

|image3|

Now that the serial port is connected, press the RESET button
once on your ameba and you should see the MicroPython’s welcome page as
shown below,

What happened here was that your Ameba first check its calibration data
and then boot into MicroPython’s firmware, MicroPython then run the
“boot.py” python script and imported builtin libraries.

Now, you can simply type

>>> help()

to see more information, and type

>>> help(modules)

to check all readily available libraries

Step 2. Run WiFi Scan example
-----------------------------

As most of peripherals’ examples requires additional hardware to show
the example is working, we will just use WiFi Scan example as our first
example and to see how easy it is to control WiFi using MicroPython.

Now, please follow along by copy+paste the following code or manually
typing them out into Tera Term and hit “Enter”

>>> from wireless import WLAN
>>> wifi = WLAN(mode = WLAN.STA)
>>> wifi.scan()



You should be able to see the returned result with all
discovered wireless network in your surrounding
