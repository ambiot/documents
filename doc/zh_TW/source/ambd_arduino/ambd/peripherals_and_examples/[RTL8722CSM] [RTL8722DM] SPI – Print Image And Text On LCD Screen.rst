[RTL8722CSM] [RTL8722DM] SPI – Print Image And Text On LCD Screen
===================================================================

If you are not familiar with SPI, please read `Introduction to
SPI <https://www.amebaiot.com/spi-intro/>`__ first.

 

Preparation

-  Ameba x 1

-  ILI9341 TFT LCD with SPI interface x 1

Example

We have tested the following two models of ILI9341 TFT LCD with SPI
interface:

-  Adafruit 2.8″ TFT LCD (with touch screen)

   -  https://www.adafruit.com/products/1651

   -  https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-8-tft-touch-shield-v2?view=all

-  QVGA 2.2″ TFT LCD

   -  http://www.lcdwiki.com/2.2inch_SPI_Module_ILI9341_SKU:MSP2202

Common pins in ILI9341 TFT LCD with SPI interface:

-  MOSI: Standard SPI Pin

-  MISO: Standard SPI Pin

-  SLK: Standard SPI Pin

-  CS: Standard SPI Pin

-  RESET: Used to reboot LCD.

-  D/C: Data/Command. When it is at Low, the signal transmitted are
      commands, otherwise the data transmitted are data.

-  LED (or BL): Adapt the screen backlight. Can be controlled by PWM or
      connected to VCC for 100% backlight.

-  VCC: Connected to 3V or 5V, depends on its spec.

-  GND: Connected to GND.

Wiring example of QVGA TFT LCD:

| Wiring example of Adafruit 2.8” TFT LCD touch shield:
| Please note that this shield model enables the backlight by default
  and pin 8 is not for backlight, and the VCC should be connected to 5V.

Open the example, “Files” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaSPI” ->
“ILI9341_TFT_LCD_basic”

| Compile and upload to Ameba, then press the reset button.
| Then you can see some display tests appear on the LCD screen, such as
  displaying different colors, drawing vertical and horizontal lines,
  drawing circles, etc.…

Code Reference

-  |  **RGB 16-bit**
      | ILI9341 uses RGB 16-bit to display colors. Different from RGB
        24-bit, it uses 5 bits for red, 6 bits for green, 5 bits for
        blue. For example, the RGB 24-bit representation of sky blue is
        0x87CEFF, that is in binary:

   -  Red: 0x87 = B10000111

   -  Green: 0xCE = B11001110

   -  Blue: 0xFF = B11111111

..

   and converted to RGB 16-bit:

-  Red: B10000

-  Green: B110011

-  Blue: B11111

..

   Then concatenate them, which forms B1000011001111111 = 0x867F

-  **Drawing of ILI9341**

   -  First you must specify the range of the rectangle to draw, then
         pass the 2-byte RGB 16-bit color to ILI9341 corresponding to
         each pixel one by one, in this way ILI9341 fills each color to
         each pixel.

   -  You still must specify the drawing range even though the range
         covers only one pixel.

   -  From the rules we mentioned above, we can conclude that drawing
         vertical or horizontal lines are faster than diagonal lines.

-  **Printing text on ILI9341**

   -  In our API, each character is 5×7 but each character is printed to
         size 6×8 (its right side and below are left blank), so as to
         separate from next character. For example, the character
         “A”:|5|

   -  The font size represents the dot size. For example, if the font
         size is 2, each dot in the character is a 2×2 rectangle

-  **Screen rotation**

   -  ILI9341 provides 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees screen rotation.

   -  If the original width is 240 and original height is 320, when the
         screen rotates 90 degrees, the width becomes 320 and the height
         becomes 240.
