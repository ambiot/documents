===================================

**Examples**

-  **SDFS File Manipulation**

Materials:

-  Ameba x 1

-  MicroSD Card x 1

..

   Steps:

   SD File System is supported on MicroPython RTL8722 port through
   importing the \```sdfs``\` module. This module is a simplified file
   system with the aim to highlight SD card manipulation, thus it does
   not support virtual file system as well as virtual file object.

Copy and paste the following code line by line into REPL to see its
effect.

Note: No file open or close is needed, the API does that automatically
for you.
