**Intro to MQTT**
:raw-html:`</p>`

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a protocol proposed by IBM
and Eurotech. The introduction in `MQTT Official
Website <http://mqtt.org/>`__: MQTT is a machine-to-machine
(M2M)/”Internet of Things” connectivity protocol. It was designed as an
extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. We can say
MQTT is a protocol designed for IoT. MQTT is based on TCP/IP and
transmits/receives data via publish/subscribe. Please refer to the
figure below:

In the operation of MQTT, there are several roles:

-  **Publisher**: Usually publishers are the devices equipped with sensors
   (ex. Ameba). Publishers uploads the data of the sensors to
   MQTT-Broker, which serves as a database with MQTT service.

-  **Subscriber**: Subscribers are referred to the devices which receive and
   observe messages, such as a laptop or a mobile phone.

-  **Topic**: Topic is used to categorized the messages, for example the
   topic of a message can be “PM2.5” or “Temperature”. Subscribers
   can choose messages of which topics they want to receive.

**Example**
:raw-html:`</p>`

| In this example, we connect Ameba to MQTT-Broker. Then send messages as
  publisher and receive messages from MQTT-Broker as subscriber.
| Open the MQTT example ``“File” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaMQTTClient” ->
  “MQTT_Basic”``
| |2|
| Please modify some WiFi-related parameters. 
| And some information related to MQTT:
| |3|  

The “mqttServer” refers to the MQTT-Broker, we use the free MQTT sandbox 
“test.mosquitto.org” for testing. 
  
  - “clientId” is an identifier for MQTT-Broker to identify the connected device. 
  - “publishTopic” is the topic of the published message, we use “outTopic” in the example. The devices subscribe to “outTopic”
    will receive the message. 
  - “publishPayload” is the content to be published. 
  - “subscribeTopic” is to tell MQTT-broker which topic we want to subscribe to. 

| Next, compile the code and upload it to Ameba. Press the reset button, then open the serial monitor
| |4|  
| After Ameba is connected to MQTT server, it sends the message “hello world” to “outTopic”. 
| To see the message, we need another MQTT client. 
| Here we use a chrome plugin “MQTTLens” to be the MQTT client. You can find it in google webstore.
| |5|

Install and open the MQTTLens, click “+” next
to “Connection” on the left, and fill in the required information

  - **Connection Name**: Used to identify the connection, you can choose a
    name you like.
  - **Hostname**: The MQTT-Broker server, here we use “iot.eclipse.org”
  - **Client ID**: We use the default randomly generated ID.

| Then click “CREATE CONNECTION”.
| |6|
| Since we have not registered the topic we want to listen to, we would not receive any messages now. 
| Fill in “outTopic” in the “Topic” field and click “Subscribe”. 
| Wait for Ameba to send next message (or you can press the reset button). Then you can see the 
  “hello world” message show up.
