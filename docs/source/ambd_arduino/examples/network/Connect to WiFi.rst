There three common encryption type in WiFi connection. The first one is
“OPEN”, which means there is no password needed to connect to this
network. The second type of encryption is WPA, which requires the
correct password to access. The third type is WEP, which requires a
hexadecimal password and a keyindex.

In the following, we will give a brief introduction on how to establish
WiFi connection with these three types of encryption on Ameba.

First, make sure the correct Ameba development board is selected in
“Tools” -> “Board”.

   - Open (WiFi connection without password)

      Open the “ConnectNoEncryption” example in ``“File” -> “Examples” ->
      “AmebaWiFi” -> “ConnectWithWiFi” -> “ConnectNoEncryption”`` |1| \

      In the sample code, modify “ssid” to be the same as the WiFi SSID to be
      connected to.

      Next, upload the sample code, and press the reset button on Ameba. Then
      you will see a message “You’re connected to the networkSSID: XXXXX”, and
      the information of this WiFi connection is printed in the serial monitor
      every 10 seconds. |2| \

   -  WiFi connection with WPA encryption

      Open the “ConnectWithWPA” example in ``“File” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaWiFi”
      -> “ConnectWithWiFi” -> “ConnectWithWPA”`` |3|\

      In the sample code, modify “ssid” to the WiFi SSID to be connected to
      and “pass” to the network password.

      Next, upload the sample code, and press the reset button on Ameba. Then
      you will see a message “You’re connected to the networkSSID: XXXXX”, and
      the information of this WiFi connection is printed in the serial monitor
      every 10 seconds.

-  WiFi connection with WEP encryption

      Open the “ConnectWithWEP” example in ``“File” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaWiFi”
      -> “ConnectWithWiFi” -> “ConnectWithWEP”`` |4|\         
      
      In the sample code, modify “ssid” to the SSID to be connected, “key” to
      the hexadecimal password, “keyIndex” to your key index number.

      Next, upload the sample code, and press the reset button on Ameba. Then
      you will see a message “You’re connected to the networkSSID: XXXXX”, and
      the information of this WiFi connection is printed in the IDE every 10
      seconds.

| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiBegin
| To get the information of a WiFi connection:
| Use ``WiFi.SSID()`` to get SSID of the current connected network.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiSSID
| Use ``WiFi.RSSI()`` to get the signal strength of the connection.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiRSSI
| Use ``WiFi.encryptionType()`` to get the encryption type of the WiFi
  connection.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiEncryptionType
| Use ``WiFi.BSSID()`` to get the MAC address of the router you are
  connected to.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiBSSID
| To get the information of Ameba:
| Use ``WiFi.macAddress()`` to get the MAC address of Ameba.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiMACAddress
| Use ``WiFi.localIP()`` to get the IP address of Ameba.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiLocalIP
| Use ``WiFi.subnetMask()`` to get the subnet mask.
| https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiSubnetMask
| Use ``WiFi.gatewayIP()`` to get the WiFi shield’s gateway IP address.

**Comparison with Arduino**
:raw-html:`</p>`

| In the Arduino platform, we need to add an extra WiFi shield to be the
  WiFi module to realize the WiFi connection. And we must ``#include`` to
  use SPI to communicate with WiFi module.
| However, Ameba is already equipped with WiFi module. Therefore,
  ``#include`` is not needed.
