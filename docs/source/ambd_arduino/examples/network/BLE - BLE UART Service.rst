**Introduction**

| With BLE, application data is sent and received using the GATT system.
  GATT uses services, characteristics, and attributes to organise data
  and control how the data can be read from and written to. The
  Bluetooth SIG specification for BLE includes several predefined
  services for common applications, but users are free to implement
  custom services and characteristics to best fit their data structure
  and application needs
| In this example, the BLEService and BLECharacteristic classes are used
  to implement a custom service for transmitting ASCII characters
  similar to regular UART. This custom service is the Nordic UART
  Service, which is supported in several smartphone apps.

**Procedure**

| Ensure that a compatible BLE UART app is installed on your smartphone,
  it is available at:
| – Google Play Store:
| https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adafruit.bluefruit.le.connect
| https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal

| – Apple App Store:
| https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefruit-connect/id830125974

Open the example, ``“Files” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaBLE” ->
“BLEUartService”``.

| Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is
  finished.
| Open the app on your smartphone, scan and connect to the Ameba board
  shown as “AMEBA_BLE_DEV” and choose the UART function in the app. Note
  that the BLE UART service on the Ameba board will only work with the
  UART and Plotter functions in the Bluefruit Connect app, other
  functions (Pin I/O, Image Transfer) require other BLE services that
  are not included in this example.

| In the UART terminal section of the app, enter a message and click
  send. You should see the message appear in the Arduino serial monitor.
| In the Arduino serial monitor, enter a message and click send. The
  message will appear in the smartphone app.

**Code Reference**
:raw-html:`</p>`

| The BLECharacteristic class is used to create two characteristics, one
  for receive (Rx) and one for transmit (Tx), and added to a service
  created with the BLEService class.
| The required read/write/notify properties are set for each
  characteristic using the ``set__Property()`` methods, and callback
  functions are registered using the ``set__Callback()`` methods. The
  required buffer size is also set for each characteristic so that it
  has enough memory to store a complete string.
| When data is written to the receive characteristic, the registered
  callback function is called, which prints out the received data as a
  string to the serial monitor.
| When data is received on the serial port, it is copied into the
  transmit characteristic buffer, and the ``notify()`` method is used to
  inform the connected device of the new data.
