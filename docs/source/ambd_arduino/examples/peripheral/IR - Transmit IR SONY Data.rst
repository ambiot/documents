-  AmebaD [ AMB21 / AMB22 / BW16 ] x 2

-  Grove – Infrared Emitter x1 (Figure 1)

**Example**
:raw-html:`</p>`

In this example, we use one Ameba RTL8722 modules that connecting with
an infrared (IR) Emitter to transmit and receive IR SONY data “0xA90”
(Sony TV power code). For the receiver side, you can either use an
oscilloscope/logic analyser to view the waveform and decode accordingly.

Figure 1: Grove – Infrared Transmitter

On the transmission side, the transmitter will send IR SONY data. For
more details, please refer to SB-Projects’ topic of IR Remote Control
Theory to learn the theory of IR remote controls operation and a
collection of IR protocol descriptions. In this example, we are going to
use Sony as the transmission protocol.

**Sony Features**

-  12-bit version, 7 command bits, 5 address bits.

-  Pulse width modulation.

-  Carrier frequency of 40kHz.

-  Bit time of 1.2ms or 0.6ms.

**Sony SIRC Modulation**

The SIRC protocol uses pulse width encoding of the bits. The pulse
representing a logical "1" is a 1200us long burst of the 40kHz carrier,
while the burst width for a logical "0" is 600us long. All bursts are
separated by a 600us long space interval as shown in Figure 2 below.

Figure 3: 12-bit Sony SIRC protocol

The Figure 3 above shows a typical pulse train of the 12-bit SIRC
protocol. With this protocol the LSB is transmitted first. The start
burst is always 2.4ms wide, followed by a standard space of 0.6ms. Apart
from signalling the start of a SIRC message this start burst is also
used to adjust the gain of the IR receiver. Then the 7-bit Command is
transmitted, followed by the 5-bit Device address. In this case Address
1 and Command 19 is transmitted.

Commands are repeated every 45ms (measured from start to start) for as
long as the key on the remote control is held down.

Figure 4 shows the pin configuration of IR Emitter with AMB21 / AMB22
board.

After the connection is being set up correctly, we will move to the
coding part for this example. First, make sure the correct Ameba
development board is selected in Arduino IDE: “Tools” -> “Board”.

Open the “IRSendSONY” example in “File” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaIRDevice”
-> “IRSendSONY” (Figure 6) and upload to the board connected with IR
Emitter:

Figure 6: Example Location of IRSendSONY

After successfully upload the sample code for IRSendSONY, you could use
oscilloscope or Pulse View software to find out the waveform of the
signal transmitted from the IR Emitter is “0xA90” as shown in Figure
below:
