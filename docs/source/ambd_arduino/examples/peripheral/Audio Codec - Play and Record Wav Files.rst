   - AmebaD [RTL8722DM MINI] x 1
   - MicroSD card

**Example**
:raw-html:`</p>`

**Procedure**

As RTL8722DM MINI have a built in microphone on the board, there is no need for any external microphone. Copy a sample wav file into the MicroSD card for demo. (In this example, the sample name is “Test_Audio_48khz_16bit_stereo.wav”. ) Then insert the MicroSD card into the adapter at the back of the board.

Example 01 PlaybackWavFile
Open the example, ``“Files” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaAudioCodec” -> “PlaybackWavFile”``.

  |image2|

Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.
Insert earphone/speaker into the onboard jack for playing the sample sound.

Example 02 RecordWavFile
Open the example, ``“Files” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaAudioCodec” -> “RecordWavFile”``.

| Define a GPIO/button(Input high to active) for “RECORDBTN”. Define the “filename[]” for name of the storge wav file. 
  In this example the name is “Test_Recording_48khz_16bit_mono.wav”.
| Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.
| Input high to “RECORDBTN”, then record voice by on board mic. When input is low the record stops. The recorded voice will be stored in “Test_Recording_48khz_16bit_mono.wav” that located at MicroSD card.

Example 03 RecordPlaybackWav
Open the example, ``“Files” -> “Examples” -> “AmebaAudioCodec” -> “RecordPlaybackWav”``.

  |image4|

| This example is a combination of Example01 and Example02. You can record by Example02 then play it by jack as the method of Example01.
| Define a GPIO/button(Input high to active) for “RECORDBTN”. Define the “filename[]” for name of the storge wav file. In this example the name is 
| “Test_Recording_48khz_16bit_mono.wav”.
| Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.
| Input high to “RECORDBTN”, then record voice by on board mic. When input is low the record stops. The recorded voice will be stored in 
| “Test_Recording_48khz_16bit_mono.wav” that located at MicroSD card.
| Insert earphone/speaker into the onboard jack for playing the sample sound.
