"BLE connections use a server client model. The server contains the data "
"of interest, while the client connects to the server to read the data. "
"Commonly, a Bluetooth peripheral device acts as a server, while a "
"Bluetooth central device acts as a client. Servers can contain many "
"services, with each service containing a some set of data. Clients can "
"send requests to read or write some data and can also subscribe to "
"notifications so that the server can send data updates to a client."

"BLE使用的是服务器–客户端模型。服务器我们感兴趣的数据，而客户端连接到服务器来读取数据。"
"通常，蓝牙外围设备充当服务器，而蓝牙中心设备充当客户端。"
"服务器可以包含许多服务，每个服务包含一组数据。"
"客户端可以发送读取或写入数据的请求，还可以订阅通知，以便服务器可以向客户端发送数据更新。"
