"mDNS (Multicast DNS) is a protocol used in the local area network. It "
"delivers the network information like IP address and provided services to"
" others. mDNS is based on the UDP protocol, and it sends packets to "
"224.0.0.251 with port 5353 under IPv4 address. The naming style for the "
"service follows the format: **{Instance Name}.{Protocol Name}.{Domain}**"
