"BLE connections use a server client model. The server contains the data "
"of interest, while the client connects to the server to read the data. "
"Commonly, a Bluetooth peripheral device acts as a server, while a "
"Bluetooth central device acts as a client. Servers can contain many "
"services, with each service containing a some set of data. Clients can "
"send requests to read or write some data and can also subscribe to "
"notifications so that the server can send data updates to a client."
