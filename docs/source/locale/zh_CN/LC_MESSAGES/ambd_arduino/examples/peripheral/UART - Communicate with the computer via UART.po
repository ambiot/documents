"UART uses two wire, one for transmitting and the other one for receiving,"
" so the data transmission is bidirectional. The communication uses a "
"predefined frequency (baud rate) to transmit data. In Arduino, UART is "
"called “Serial”. There is only one hardware UART on Arduino Uno and it is"
" primarily used to read the log and messages printed by Arduino (so it is"
" also called “Log UART”). If we use the hardware UART for other purposes,"
" the Log UART does not have resources to function. To provide more UART "
"connections, it is possible to use a GPIO pin to simulate the behavior of"
" UART with a software approach, this is called Software Serial. Ameba is "
"equipped with several hardware UART ports, but it is also compatible with"
" the Software Serial library."
