"MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a protocol proposed by IBM "
"and Eurotech. The introduction in `MQTT Official Website "
"<http://mqtt.org/>`__: MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/”Internet of "
"Things” connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely "
"lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. We can say MQTT is a "
"protocol designed for IoT. MQTT is based on TCP/IP and transmits/receives"
" data via publish/subscribe. Please refer to the figure below:"
