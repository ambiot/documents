"UART is a very versatile communication protocol and almost an essential "
"part of a microcontroller. A TTL USB to Serial module is an IC that helps"
" to translate UART signal to USB signal so that we can see uart log "
"printed on our PC. This module is often found on many development boards,"
" including ameba. However, the module on Ameba is reserved for LOG UART "
"and Firmware uploading, that is why we need a separate module to "
"communicate between ameba and PC."
