"SPI is a fast and robust communication protocol that are commonly found "
"on many microcontrollers and is often used to retrieve sensor data or "
"output image signal to a display. Ameba support SPI in both master and "
"slave mode. Here we are going to see an example demonstrating how ameba "
"receive data in slave mode on MicroPython."
