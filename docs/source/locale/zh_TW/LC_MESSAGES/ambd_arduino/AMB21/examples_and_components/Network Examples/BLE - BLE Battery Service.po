"BLE connections use a server client model. The server contains the data "
"of interest, while the client connects to the server to read the data. "
"Commonly, a Bluetooth peripheral device acts as a server, while a "
"Bluetooth central device acts as a client. Servers can contain many "
"services, with each service containing a some set of data. Clients can "
"send requests to read or write some data and can also subscribe to "
"notifications so that the server can send data updates to a client."
msgstr "BLE使用的是服務器–客戶端模型。服務器我們感興趣的數據，而客戶端連接到服務器來讀取數據。"
"通常，藍牙外圍設備充當服務器，而藍牙中心設備充當客戶端。服務器可以包含許多服務，"
"每個服務包含一組數據。客戶端可以發送讀取或寫入數據的請求，還可以訂閱通知，以便服務器可以向客戶端發送數據更新。"
