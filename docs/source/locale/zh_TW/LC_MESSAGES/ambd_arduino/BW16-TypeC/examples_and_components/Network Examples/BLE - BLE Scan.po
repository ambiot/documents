"``setScanMode(GAP_SCAN_MODE_ACTIVE)`` is used to set the scan mode. "

"from a device when it is found. Passive scanning will only look at the "
"advertisement data, and not request for additional data."

"``setScanInterval()`` and ``setScanWindow()`` are used to set the "
"frequency and duration of scans in milliseconds. A scan will start every "
"interval duration, and each scan will last for the scan window duration. "
"The scan window duration should be lesser or equal to the scan interval. "
"Set a short interval to discover devices rapidly, set a long interval to "
"conserve power."

"``setScanCallback(scanFunction)`` is used to register a function to be "

"function for additional processing of scan data, such as looking for a "

"formatted and printed to the serial monitor by default."

"process will stop, and will be ready to be started again."
