"HC-SR04 is a module that uses ultrasound to measure the distance. It "
"looks like a pair of eyes in its appearance, therefore it’s often "
"installed onto robot-vehicle or mechanical bugs to be their eyes. The way"
" it works is that first we “toggle high” the TRIG pin (that is to pull "
"high then pull low). The HC-SR04 would send eight 40kHz sound wave signal"
" and pull high the ECHO pin. When the sound wave returns back, it pull "
"low the ECHO pin."

"Assume the velocity of sound is 340 m/s, the time it takes for the sound "
"to advance 1 cm in the air is 340*100*10^-6 = 29 us. The sound wave "
"actually travels twice the distance between HC-SR04 and the object, "
"therefore the distance can be calculated by (time/29) / 2 = time / 58. "
"The working voltage of HC-SR04 is 5V. When we pull high the ECHO pin to "
"5V, the voltage might cause damage to the GPIO pin of Ameba. To avoid "
"this situation, we need to drop the voltage as follows:"
