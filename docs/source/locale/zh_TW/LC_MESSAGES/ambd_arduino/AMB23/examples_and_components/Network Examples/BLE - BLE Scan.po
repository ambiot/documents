"``setScanMode(GAP_SCAN_MODE_ACTIVE)`` is used to set the scan mode. "

"from a device when it is found. Passive scanning will only look at the "
"advertisement data, and not request for additional data."
msgstr ""
"setScanMode(GAP_SCAN_MODE_ACTIVE) 用於設置掃描模式。當找到設備時，主動掃描模式將向設備請求多一次額外的掃描響應數據包。"

"``setScanInterval()`` and ``setScanWindow()`` are used to set the "
"frequency and duration of scans in milliseconds. A scan will start every "
"interval duration, and each scan will last for the scan window duration. "
"The scan window duration should be lesser or equal to the scan interval. "
"Set a short interval to discover devices rapidly, set a long interval to "
"conserve power."
msgstr ""
"setScanInterval() 和 setScanWindow() 用於設置以毫秒為單位的掃描頻率和持續時間。掃描將每隔一段時間啟動一次，"
"並且每次掃描都將持續整個掃描窗口時間。掃描窗口時間應該小於或等於掃描間隔。設置短間隔可快速發現設備，設置長間隔可節約電能。"

"``setScanCallback(scanFunction)`` is used to register a function to be "

"function for additional processing of scan data, such as looking for a "
"specific device. If no function is registered, the scan results are "
"formatted and printed to the serial monitor by default."
msgstr ""
"setScanCallback(scanFunction) 用於註冊一個接收到掃描結果時調用的函數。它可以用來設置用戶自定義函數，"
"以便對掃描數據進行額外的處理，例如查找特定的設備。如果沒有註冊函數，掃描結果將被收集整理並在默認情況下打印到串行監視器。"
