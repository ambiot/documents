"In this example, we will use this simple watchdog timer example runs on "
"the Ameba RTL8722 module to illustrate how to use the watchdog API. "
"Before we get into the details of the example, let’s briefly go through "
"the definition of Watchdog as well as it’s working principles."

"Watchdog Timer (WDT) is a hardware timer that is used to detect the "
"occurrence of a software fault, then automatically generates a system "
"reset or a watchdog interrupt on the expiry of a programmed period."

"In layman terms, imagine in the situation while your micro-controller is "
"confused in an infinity loop, or any case like the micro-controller hang "
"while performing some tasks. The normal troubleshooting method would be "
"to press the reset button and jump out of the infinity loop. However, is "
"it practically impossible to do press on the button all time, therefore, "
"the watchdog timer that embedded inside the micro-controller would help "
"with this situation."

"In our example, we created 2 tasks that contain some loop that runs "

"For the successful case, the watchdog is being refreshed/feed within 5 "
"seconds, however, for the failed case, the loop is under processing and "
"the watchdog is not being fresh after 5 seconds, which triggers the "
"watchdog (dog barks), an interrupt is generated to reset the processor. "
"Likewise, the watchdog timer protects the micro-controller from the "
