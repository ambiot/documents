"In this example, two RTL8722 boards are connected using BLE. One board "
"runs a BLE UART service, while the other connects to the service using a "
"client and both boards are able to communicate with text messages over "
"the UART service."

"Reset the UART service board first, wait for the BLE advertisement "

"characteristic. Any message typed in the serial terminal will be sent to "

"The BLEClient class is used to discover the services that exist on a "
"connected BLE device. The discovery process will create BLERemoteService,"
" BLERemoteCharacteristic and BLERemoteDescriptor objects corresponding to"
" the services, characteristics and descriptors that exist on the "
"connected device. These objects can then be used to read and write data "
"to the connected device."
